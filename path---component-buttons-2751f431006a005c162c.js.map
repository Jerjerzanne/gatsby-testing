Primary buttons, buttons that indicate a call to action, are the most prominent. Secondary buttons, which indicate less commonly used actions, should be less prominent than primary buttons. Buttons always indicate an action and are not to be used for navigation. Buttons are placed where a user should expect them, i.e. in close proximity to the other elements that the action affects.</p>\\n<h2>Size and Padding</h2>\\n<p>Buttons used in this design system have a minimum size of 10mm x 10mm. This is the typical size of a user's finger pad when using the application on mobile. For web this minimum size is also consistent.</p>\\n<p>The more white-space <em><strong>padding</strong></em> around a button, the more prominent the button appears on the page. Most buttons in this system use 15px of padding, but are otherwise indicated.</p>\\n<h2>Labels</h2>\\n<p>Button labels should be clear and specific. Avoid generic terms like Save, Submit or Cancel. Buttons should indicate the exact action that is taken and should provide a clear idea of what will happen next.</p>\\n<p>Examples of good button labels: Add a blog post, Send message, Back to menu.</p>\\n<p>All labels should capitalize only the first letter of the label.</p>\\n<p>Label text has high contrast with the button colour. See below for specific text colours for each type of button.</p>\\n<h2>Varying States</h2>\\n<p>Buttons are not one-state objects. Most users will recognize a button because of its hover and active states. Varying states also provide feedback to the user at each stage of performing the action.</p>\\n<p>Buttons should include normal, hover, focus, active and disabled states:</p>\\n<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Even in its normal state, a button should look like a button! Before hovering, a user should be able to tell that an element is clickable.</p>\\n<p><strong>Hover:</strong> Usually indicated by a change in colour or animation, hover states indicate to the user that the element is clickable.</p>\\n<p><strong>Focus:</strong> Similar to hover states, focus states indicate that the user has tabbed to the specific button.</p>\\n<p><strong>Active/Pressed:</strong> Usually indicated by a change in colour or animation, this indicates that the user has clicked or pressed a button/</p>\\n<p><strong>Disabled:</strong> Usually a ghosted version of the normal state, this indicates to the user that the action is unavailable.</p>\\n<h2>Primary Buttons</h2>\\n<p>Primary buttons identify a call to action. Use these buttons for actions that a user is encouraged to take such as Add a blog post, Send message, or Login. Try to keep button labels limited to one or two words.</p>\\n<p>Primary buttons are designed to have high contrast against the background and the heaviest visual weight. They typically use brighter colours than other elements on the form or layout, and are located in a visible and accessible area of the page.</p>\\n<p>Primary buttons use the primary colour, with white text. Sizing of the button depends on the length of the <em><strong>action words</strong></em>.</p>\\n<p>Each of the states for primary buttons are as follows:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\".gitbook/assets/button_primary.png\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Regular state:</strong> primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\".gitbook/assets/button_primary_hover.png\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Hover state:</strong> primary colour at 80% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\".gitbook/assets/button_primary_focus.png\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Focus state:</strong> primary colour at 80% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.

Generally, in a set of two, primary buttons are placed on the left and the secondary button is placed on the right. </p>\\n<h2>Secondary Buttons</h2>\\n<p>Secondary buttons are used for actions that are necessary to provide, but that users may click less often. Examples include actions such as Cancel submission, Delete or Back to menu. <em><strong>(All of these are reverse actions. Is that something to mention maybe?)</strong></em> These buttons have a visual weight that is equal to or less than the majority of elements on the page. The secondary button is usually placed in close proximity to the primary button. Try to keep button labels limited to one or two words.</p>\\n<p>Secondary buttons, particularly ones used for destructive actions, should be designed in a way that deters users from clicking on it. For example, the button could be in a shade of red. ****This helps minimize mistakes.</p>\\n<p>For permanent destructive secondary actions, such as Delete, clicking the button may bring the user to a second window to confirm the action.</p>\\n<p>Secondary buttons in this system are transparent with a stroke colour.

Secondary buttons are usually placed to the right of the primary button_. _They should have a consistent placement relative to the primary button to avoid confusion.</p>\\n<h2>Drop-Down Buttons</h2>\\n<p>Drop down buttons display a list of items when clicked.

The drop-down arrow represents a space of 30px by 40px, which is separated from the primary button using a white line. The arrow uses a space of 15px width and 8px in height. Whichever piece of the button (primary or drop-down section) is being hovered over is shown at 80% opacity.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\".gitbook/assets/button_drop-down_focus_1.png\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Focus State:</strong> Similar to the primary button, drop-down buttons use the primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. The drop-down arrow represents a space of 30px by 40px, which is separated from the primary button using a white line. The arrow uses a space of 15px width and 8px in height.

The action box uses a 1px border using #CECECE. The box has a border radius of 4px. The width of the box is 166px, and the height depends on the number of actions, using 40px per action.
