{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>Badges</h1>\n<p>Badges are used to show notifications and other alerts related to a particular element. Badges do not stand alone, but are combined with text, icons or buttons to show a change or action related to that feature. For example, a badge beside your Inbox link to show the number of unread emails.</p>\n<p>When coding badges, the alternative text that will be read by screen readers should also include context. For example, the badge should read \"40 unread emails\" instead of just \"40\".</p>\n<p>Badges in this design system appear as follows:</p>\n<p><Badge color=\"secondary\">New</Badge></p>\n<p>Rectangle with a width of <strong>28px</strong> and height of <strong>19px</strong>. Border radius of <strong>8px</strong>. Background colour of #4D5D6C. Text colour of #FFFFFF. Text is centred within the rectangle.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/component/badges","import":"hey"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"component-badges-efd","internalComponentName":"ComponentComponentBadges","path":"/component/badges","component":"/home/simon/v2gatsby-testing/src/templates/mdTemplate.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-md-template-js","context":{},"updatedAt":1530046542753,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/simon/v2gatsby-testing/src/templates/mdTemplate.js"}}
